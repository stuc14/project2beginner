		<p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>
		<img src="img/chair1.png">
		<p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York</p>
		<p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?</p>
		<blockquote>"Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; to the best of your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world" </blockquote>
		<br>
		<span>- Charles Eames</span>
		<p>The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function. "The details are not details", said Charles. "They make the product".</p>

		<p>Their own concepts evloved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".</p>
		<p>A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place". That they did. Tsat also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
